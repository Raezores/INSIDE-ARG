# Contributing

Keeping up with all the developments of the ARG, and comprehensively documenting puzzles from beginning to end can be a very time-consuming undertaking. Therefor help in any regard is very much appreciated.

You can find a To Do list of things I'm currently working on, and ideas for future things to add in our [Main Mission](https://github.com/twinysam/INSIDE-ARG/projects/2).

If you have questions, suggestions or ideas, feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/twinysam/INSIDE-ARG/discussions).

If you notice any mistakes, anything that needs correcting or improving, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/twinysam/INSIDE-ARG/issues/new).

If you'd like to be more proactive and submit a correction or improvement yourself, you can [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

If you intend to contribute something significant (anything that would represent a time investment of more than a few minutes), please [open a discussion first](https://github.com/twinysam/INSIDE-ARG/discussions), so that we can coordinate our efforts.

## Contact me

Besides the Github Discussions, you can reach me out under my same handle (twinysam) over at the Playdead Unofficial Discord: https://discord.gg/gQ74gaa 

## Using Github

If you are completely new to Github, I very much recommend this video series to get started, which assumes no prior knowledge: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV

And you can find the official Getting Started guide here: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github

## Using markdown

Our documentation is made using plain text files formatted with markdown. It's the same syntax used on many other sites like Reddit and Discord, and it has many uses.

Here you can learn the basic and most used syntax: https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

These documents can be opened with any text file editor, and edited directly online through the github website.

There are even quite a few really cool (free) editors which do syntax highlighting, which makes writing in markdown even more appealing. Some of these are:

- [Ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) (Windows/Linux)
- [Notepad2e](https://github.com/ProgerXP/Notepad2e) (Windows only)
- [Typora](https://typora.io/) (Windows/Linux/Mac)
- [Mark Text](https://marktext.app/) (Windows/Linux/Mac)

If you want something packing a bit more power and features, you can try one of these (all are cross-platform):

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
